Description: There are 3 sets of USA maps contained within this data set. 1) A
    map of the USA with the NAD 1983 Albers Projection from the USGS that was
    originally part of 'USGSstates2k' which has been archived and is no longer
    maintained. Irucka worked with that data set while a Cherokee Nation
    Technology Solutions (CNTS) USGS Contractor and/or USGS employee. 2) A
    NAD83 datum map of the USA which includes all State boundaries & also
    includes Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This map comes from the
    USGS National Map which has been discontinued. 3) A WGS84 datum map of the
    USA which includes all State boundaries & also includes Puerto Rico and the
    U.S. Virgin Islands. This map is a reprojection of the NAD83 datum map from
    the USGS National Map.
