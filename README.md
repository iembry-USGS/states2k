# USA.state.boundaries

R data package containing 3 sets of maps of the United States of America (USA). 1) A map of the USA with the NAD 1983 Albers Projection from the USGS that was originally part of `USGSstates2k` which has been archived and is no longer maintained. This map is identified as USA_state_boundaries. Irucka worked with that data set while a Cherokee Nation Technology Solutions (CNTS) USGS Contractor and/or USGS employee. 2) A NAD83 datum map of the USA which includes all State boundaries & also includes Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This map is identified as statesp010. This map comes from the USGS National Map which has been discontinued. 3) A WGS84 datum map of the USA which includes all State boundaries & also includes Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This map has been identified as state_boundaries_wgs84. This map is a reprojection of the NAD83 datum map from the USGS National Map.
